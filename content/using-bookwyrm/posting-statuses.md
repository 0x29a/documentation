Posting on BookWyrm is similar to [posting on Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/) in that statuses have visibility settings, content warnings, and mentions. However, polls and attachments are not supported.

## Types of posts

There are three types of posts: reviews, comments, and quotes. Comments respond to general aspects of a book, quotes pertain to specific passages, and reviews deal with books overall. All statuses are linked to specific books.
