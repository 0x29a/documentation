Order: 1

Posting on BookWyrm is similar to [posting on Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/) in that statuses have visibility settings, content warnings, and mentions. However, polls, custom emoji, and attachments are not supported. All posts are linked to specific books.

## Types of statuses

### User commentary

There are three types of posts users can create directly in response to books: reviews, comments, and quotes. Comments respond to general aspects of a book, quotes pertain to specific passages, and reviews deal with books overall. Users can also reply to statuses.

| Component | Review | Comment | Quote | Reply |
