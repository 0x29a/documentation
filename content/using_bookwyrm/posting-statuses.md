Title: Posting statuses

Order: 1

Posting on BookWyrm starts with a book &mdash; users can write reviews, post quotes, and make general comments on books from the "Your books" sidebar (currently reading and recently read books) or from a book's page. From there, users can reply and start a conversation. BookWyrm posts support a subset of [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) options like bold, italics and links.

If you're familiar with [posting on Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/), you'll find that BookWyrm statuses have analagous visibility settings, content warnings, and mentions. However, polls, custom emoji, and attachments are not supported yet.

## Types of statuses

### User commentary

There are three types of posts users can create directly in response to books: reviews, comments, and quotes. Comments respond to general aspects of a book, quotes pertain to specific passages, and reviews deal with books overall. Users can also reply to statuses.
